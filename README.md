# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Application

The "Multiple Disease Prediction" project leverages machine learning techniques to predict various diseases, including diabetes, heart diseases, and Parkinson's, using diverse and comprehensive datasets. Each dataset is tailored to its respective disease, encompassing critical health indicators and patient data for accurate predictions. The project features Jupyter notebooks for in-depth analysis, model training, and evaluation, along with a Python script diseasePred.py for core functionalities. Additionally, the project incorporates a Streamlit application, providing a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the models. The overall accuracy of the project's predictive models is a testament to its effectiveness in disease prediction, though specific accuracy figures vary by disease.
